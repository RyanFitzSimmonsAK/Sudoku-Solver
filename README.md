# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku Solver using a backtracking algorithm with recursion.

The Output class is able to execute the keyboard controls needed to input a completed Sudoku board onto sites like sudoku.com and the NYT.
The NYTimesInput class is able to pull a puzzle directly from the NYT website.

The combination of those two classes means that you can run this and it will completely do a NYT puzzle.
